# localtree

## goal:
input a python package as a directory, & this localtree package will make a dictionary which describes the local module import heirarchy.

## eventually:
make a visual heirarchy with lines between each module.

## purpose:
so that i know what to read first when reading through python packages: modules which have no local dependencies.
