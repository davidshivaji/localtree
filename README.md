# localtree

## goal
input a python package as a directory, & this localtree package will make a dictionary which describes the local module import heirarchy.

## eventually
make a visual heirarchy with lines between each module.

## purpose
so that i know which order to read through python packages: start with modules which have no local dependencies.


If you want a visual graph of your dependencies, use [PyDeps](https://github.com/thebjorn/pydeps).
